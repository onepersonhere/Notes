5 stages
forming, storming, norming, performing, mourning

forming -> look to gp leader for guidance
culture plays a huge role:
individualism vs collectivism
power distance index - members tend not to voice their opinions during meetings
uncertainty avoidance index ^
desire for harmony/conformity, leader's decision is unchallenged
-> devil's advocate/encourage discussion

masculinity-feminity
long-term/short-term orientation
indulgence-restraint

storming -> compete for ideas/status
-> conflict -> participants must learn how to solve issue and problems together.

-> know types of conflict that is occuring 
-> substantive conflict (content), 
procedural conflict (process/ how goal is achieve), 
affective conflict (personal disagreement/prejudices)

-> diff conflict management styles -> negotiation & resolution
-> styles of management -> different situation)
-> accomodating (constantly cooperating, even at own expense) (good if the other person is an expert/ more important to preserve relations) -> preserve face of others etc.
-> avoiding (if issue is trival/ need space in an emotionally charged situation) (not good for long term)
-> competing (effective during emergencies/ stand up for rights/values)
-> compromising (temporary solution/ dateline is approaching) (lose-lose situation)
-> collaborate (work together and achieve a win-win solution)

negotiation is a dialogue btw 2 or more ppl with divergent position with the intention of reaching a consensual and beneficial outcome.
-> Preparation -> clear sense of desired outcome and know best alternative

, implementation.
-> tactics
-> -> extreme demands upgront before willing to make small concessions
-> -> non-negotiable offers
-> -> exaggerate info to throw other party offguard

culture -> verbal/non-verbal cues -> high context collectivist (not everything is said and need to read between the lines) -> long term relationship focus -> implicit info
-> low context individualistic (focus on task, building of short term relationship) -> explicit info

-> direct (reveals true intention, opinions, feelings) vs indirect style (camouflauge true intentions to maintain harmony)
-> self-enhancement (enhances self, open and direct about personal achievement, indivdualistic culture) vs self-effacement style (enhnaces what has been done, collectivistic culture, more modest)
-> elaborate vs understated
