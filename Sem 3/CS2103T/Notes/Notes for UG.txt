How to use the guide, meaning of formatting - how to navigate the document
Draw the reader to want to read more
Shift autocomplete earlier - highlight, be user-centric, when do I use the feature.
Grammar:
	from here -> here
Tell them about the empty GUI
Command format legend -> UPPER_CASE no link with multiple times

help -> phrasing -> too many things going oh here.
highlight the drop down menu (tips/special)

add -> place in a table format
highlight which part comes out different

list -> put after suggest -> relist?

edit -> may add more use cases 
Before and after editing looks the same -> maybe a arrow? 

keything-> flow of the features, logical consideration, consideration of the user (use tips/icons) when do I use the commands.
Texture cues, how do they align together.
Formatting -> explain how is it used in the guide -> eg. Blue box, Gray box, Bold.
